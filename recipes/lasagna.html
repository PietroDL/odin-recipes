    <h3>Lasagna Ingrediants</h3>

    <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>

    <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
    <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
